            Hi everyone! A few fun facts about me: I was born and raised right here in West Chester, PA. I graduated from Drexel University in 2013 with a degree in IT and a database concentration. I played soccer for the NCAA Division I team at Drexel all 5 years I was in college. I work as the Director of Data Systems at a luxury fashion re-seller with stores all across the US. I had a crush on Lena in our 8th grade English class!

            Welcome! Little ol’ me in a nutshell: I was born in Tallahassee, FL and lived in Denver, CO while growing up before moving to PA. I went to school for biology at Kansas State University and now work in the clinical research industry for a CRO.  I enjoy Eagle’s Sundays with John and dreaming up ideas for our 1860’s fixer-upper home in the West Chester Borough.  You can find me crafting, cooking, playing soccer or beating John at Hearthstone.

            <h1>The Beginnings</h1><br/><br/>
            Our story began at Rustin High School circa 2006 in West Chester, PA.  We were both captains of the soccer teams and irrefutably flirtatious.  While remaining friends throughout the years, we would see each other on our holiday breaks from college to enjoy time watching meteor showers, playing Jeopardy and competing for most correct answers, or spending New Year’s Eve together in Philadelphia (which remains our favorite adventurous holiday).  After graduating from college, Lena returned to West Chester and John was quick to act. He swept her off her feet with a romantic sushi dinner at Teikoku in celebration of her birthday. Upon reconnecting in the same time zone, we began our deeper relationship based off the solid friendship foundation built over the years.

                            In December of 2016, John and Lena traveled to Seneca, KS for Christmas with Lena’s maternal extended family.  On Monday, December 19th we were having a lazy day, relaxing at Grandma’s farm when John insisted that we go for a walk around the property. It was a brisk beautiful day and the farm was coated in a fresh layer of snow. As we walked through the front yard, Lena shared cherished memories of her time spent at the farm. John seized the unique opportunity; stopped and got on one knee - the rest is history!
